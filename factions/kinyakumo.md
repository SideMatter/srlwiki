## History

### Basics

#### Beginning of Kinyakumo
Once upon a time, where the year of humanity is marked as "2357", humanity prayed for a savior in the midst of a seventh world war. They prayed for an angel to descend, free all from suffering. However, when the lightning struck the Azure Dragon fountain in Kiyomizu Temple located in Kyoto, Japan, instead of a savior, a large egg appeared.

The egg eventually hatched a young lady with deer like antlers, blue and red gradient eyes, described with a hint of lizardry, and patches of shiny scales that of obsidian spear heads, her scales intensified more and more towards the long, dragon like tail attached to her body at the back. The fur that runs along her spine glowed by the ends.

Many began to worship this young lady, claiming her as the savior that humanity prayed for, but for some, she could also be a demon from the depths of hell, finally coming to attack humanity while it is at its weakest states. Truth is, she is just a fallen warrior from heaven, a heaven not of any faith, a heaven that exists because the hopes and delusions of humanity, or by scientific terms at the time, the so called "Imaginary". A sort of "heaven" not well understood by many.

The Kiyomizu Temple, a refuge of war victims at the time, along with the temple's monks, took in this creature and named her Longlin, Long for her dragon like appearance, and Lin for the forest that the monks hopes to recover from the devastation of war. Even with the outcries of some groups of refugees, arguing that she is a demon who must be tossed away, the monks accepted her as their own, as part of their beliefs that "demons were not born, they were made".

With the help of the temple, and Longlin's incredible learning skills and speeds, she quickly became the smartest amongst all, with her ability to come up with strategies in the midst of chaos, her encouraging speech and her commanding voice quickly won the favors of many. She had started her own army, calling it "Kinyakumo".

Kinyakumo means "The Medicinal Eye of Gold", Longlin came up with the name in order to honor the nurses and doctors, those who overcame themselves, those who abandoned humanity, those who braved hails of war, those with a keen eye, understanding the emotions of others, all in order to save anyone they can. Longlin, like the monks of the temple, wants a more peaceful world.

And so, under her command, she quickly became recognized by more and more people, she has gained power and even faith. Many fought for her, trusting her to bring about a new future, the true symbol of hope, a general of an unfathomable army, blood spilled on many soils and once living flesh decayed away. By 2399, Longlin became the new "Emperor" of Japan. Many considered her as a masculine figure, hence the title of "Emperor".

=======

#### Forming of Modern Day Kinyakumo

No freedom is without restrictions, no peace is recognized without war. Longlin, finally gotten back to her heavenly senses, possible with her dragon blood. 

Yielding her divine power, with a stomp, she split the earth, for it is her drums, beating at her intimidating march, the sound for a beautiful future. With a roar, she summoned thunder, flashes of energy overloading her enemies, for their death was instant and painless, no longer worrying. With a wave of her arm, she summoned gusts of strong winds that of hurricanes, knocking away those who inflicts pain, and soothing those who waited patiently for a cure to suffering. With the blood dripped from her wounds, she manifested them into tsunamis, washing away sins of the past. With a shine from her eyes, wildfire busted into the heart of darkness, exterminating shadows of humanity.

There is no ending, as long as she exists, the universe will keep thriving.

Lastly, with her divine spear, the Massiah, she has ended the Seventh World War. Piercing open a gate to imaginary, she has answered the lost. The deity who waits on the other side accepted everyone. She praised Longlin of her dedication, and so, the world woke up to a beautiful morning. For some, the seemingly everlasting world wars were a fever dream that ended humanity, but for others, it was real. Longlin now stands on the top of the world, for she has conquered humanity.

Under her rule, everything changed, humanity stood up, and advanced forward, walking on the bloody soil, they have achieved world peace. Kinyakumo expanded, from an army, to entirety of East Asian, now, she has the Earth, for the people, she now stands in a place respectable to a God. And under her breath, no more wars can be fought

Longlin focused on bringing knowledge to the people, advancing every technical aspects, even with the technological set backs of the world wars, Longlin brought them back, and made them even better. Eventually, humanity is able to conquer the moon, then other planets, even going as far as Neptune, but why stop there?

In the year 5555, humanity has officially conquered 7 exo-earth-like-planets along with each equipped with a Dyson Sphere[^1](Energy harnessing straight from the star of the planet). Each ruled by one nation. For those in the past, a planet size nation could be called an empire, but with the existence of Longlin, it is only part of an empire.

With the 7 planets and their rulers, they've established The Divine Guardian Council. Each planet contributes their most gifted, most talented, the planet's ultimate, and have that individual be the Divine Guardian of that planet nation. It is a position even higher than that nation's rulers, for they represent the nation as a whole and has the honor to sit by the same table as Emperor Longlin.

The Council discuss together, planning the future for humanity.

But oh, why stop at just planets? Why not go into other realms? 

=======

#### Modern Day Kinyakumo

With extensive planning, the Divine Guardians desires to make a super machine, or as they called it "Second God", an artificial, clockwork God made by humanity, to solve residue problems still reside within the world and quicken advancements. Emperor Longlin has longed for a time for her to retire from throne, and wants to live carefreely as a normal citizen, and hence forward with the plan.

In order to create the Clockwork God, they want to understand Imaginary, as such, the Q.I. research started, or quantum-imaginary, a field of science and physics devoted to understanding the fabrics of reality itself.

However, during the making of this machine, it caught the attention of the deity behind the curtain, the one who watches from the realm of Imaginary, due to the research of said field tampering with Q.I., The deity, who has seen all of time, tries her best to destroy and seal up the machine with her own power, in the process, damaging herself and the machine. For many, this marks the death of the deity.

Even with the damaged mechanism, it was still able to utilize its Q.I. tampering abilities. With last of its life, it stretched out a tear in the fabrics of reality, and hence, the portal of Q.I. Singularity formed, gaining access to another realm via imaginary.

Tsubaki, the youngest, and the seventh nation, focused mainly on businesses, trades, and technological research, was chosen as the explorer of outworlder realms. Under the rule of Tsubaki Koiwa, the Queen of the Queendom, along with her newly ascended Divine Guardian, Fuyuchi Koyuki, entered the Q.I. Singularity.

=======

#### Outworlder Branch - Kinyakumo-Tsubaki

After emerging from the other side of the Q.I. singularity, N.D.S.E. immediately got to work setting up a base and even mapping out an area for a palace to be constructed. After further scouting of the land, it seems like the realm they landed in already have societies and even empires. 

Koyuki acted as the ambassador with the nearby nations and empires, in attempt to establish supports and connections. Although, Koyuki is still quite cautious, however, in this foreign realm, Koyuki is cut off from her connection with the Divine Guardians, therefore she has the freedom to say anything and do anything in the outworlder realm.

With the help of universal translation implants, important figures such as those higher ups at N.D.S.E. and Koyuki are able to understand the local tongue with ease. Koiwa doesn't seems to need them, for reasons unknown, she can automatically understand the local tongue without any translations.

=======

#### 1.5 Impact
Distrust began to build between the head of N.D.S.E (Vanessa) and Koyuki, over the judgement of Koiwa's actions in the past. Because of this distrust, Koiwa is afraid of an infighting, and especially afraid of Koyuki disliking her. Her overthinking and lack of communication with Koyuki eventually lead to a mental breakdown that caused the 1.5 Impact. 

Almost like the First Impact, except Koiwa's flames and explosive forces were conceited inside the palace under the core suppression mechanisms; a system which is specifically designed to suppress extreme and sudden emotions that resonates with the phoenix core and Koiwa's spiritual core at the same time, supposedly, it should prevent the same disaster as the First Impact, however, the system is still in testing and it is imperfect.

Koiwa's cores meltdown anyways, and her intense emotions forced open the Gate of Guf. Like the Q.I. Singularity, the Gate of Guf leads to the imaginary, but a dimension of imaginary that is supposedly hidden and mirrors reality, it doesn't leads to another realm, it is just a physical manifestation of one's extremely strong thoughts.

Second in Command of N.D.S.E., Remilia Haganehara, also known as "Remmy", designed a specialized unit named ATLAS: Alternate Threshold Load Algorithm Suppressor, also named after the Greek mythology titan "Atlas", who held up the celestial sphere of the world. This incredibly large, human piloted, half biological humanoid machine, held the rings of the gate, stretching them open as they were collapsing down to a point, preventing further collision meltdown of the cores and also preventing the destruction of the outworlder realm they just settled in.

With the ring stretched, the Gate of Guf is unable to close and release its potential energy, thus suspended above the palace, where the phoenix core resides, also with this, the mirror realm of the palace is attracted to the real world palace due to the cores desire to become one. However, by unexplained miracle, the mirror palace seems to only be hovering above, with no movements at all.

This sparked many fears as well as inspiration for Q.I. research across Kinyakumo. With the incident also brings certain unpleasant events.

=======

#### Post 1.5 Impact

The land in which current day Kinyakumo-Tsubaki sits on in the outworlder realm, according to SSAIR (Local university) historical analysis teams, or H.A.T, the land was once a site for a civilization who vanished or was reduced rapidly due to unrecorded reasons, due to ambassador reports, a demonic entity seemed to have swept the area and caused massive reduction in population, leaving behind remnants of despair. Utilizing this report, H.A.T. concludes that the local land may have residual, unextinguished spirits that houses certain levels of force that could only be described as "magic".

The opening Gate of Guf seems to have an ongoing conflict with said local spirits, causing unexplained havoc such as sudden sickness, massive energy fluctuation and unstable energy entropy.

In response, Kinyakumo has cut ties with neighboring nation; Neo Kirameku, with the conclusion that the local spirits who belongs to the ancestor of Neo Kirameku's ruler are causing havoc due to conflicts with Q.I., in fear of any "magical" interactions that could intensify the havoc.

By isolating away from effects of this type of "magic", specifically sourced from Kirameku, Kinyakumo has closed its borders at Neo Kirameku, with any who moved into Kinyakumo from Neo Kirameku to be escorted by the K.P.D.- Kinyakumo Police Deparment. As well as local historical remnants extinguished by the Divine Spear of Tsubaki, controlled by the Queen Tsubaki Koiwa.

During this event, the K.P.D and N.D.S.E. received technological and medical aid from a neighboring empire called The Grand Yosokoan Empire, ruled under the reign of Nazorious.

| Specie: *Divine Beast - Dragon*      |

#### Background

Longlin was once a Dragon General in Heaven, a strong half dragon half man who lead the Million Steel Army and fought the other factions in heaven for power and a search for utimate wisdom, however, he fell during battle, killed by his opponent, the Lion of Gui.

Even in his death, he fought through the afterlife for a chance to be reborn and settle his scores with the Lion of Gui, however, his rashness and his thirst for war was punished. Instead of reborn as his former, glorious self, he was reborn as a young lady inside the lotus leaves of a shrine.

Longlin retained some memories, although angry at the heavens, she eventually accepts the punishment, and live her life on Earth amongst mortals. Her leadership attitude won the favors of many and her still-clear divine knowledge helped aid humanity in technology. She quickly rose to power, eventually founding her own empire which she named Kinyakumo, meaning golden medicinal eye.

She decides that peace can also be an option, as she remembers her days in heaven were brutal, war and violence was the daily norm, and the batles she had to lead her army through in order to end the Seventh World War, peace could be a change of scenery.

Under her powerful rule, she decides to expand out to the stars, settling in other planets, whilist leaving the original Earth as diverse as it is, even if Kinyakumo became most of the Earth.


#### Personality

Longlin is the definition of "small but festy". Even after thousands of years living in her small mortal body, she still isn't used to being called "small" or "short", as she dislikes being teased for her height, because of it, Longlin often appear to her subjects as a 80 meter tall hologram dragon man, only those who are close to her such as the various kingdom/queendom leaders or The Divine Guardian Council knows of her true appearances.

She can become extremely straightforward with her words, as she believes that sugarcoating is a waste of time, and that those who cannot handle what is reality are not fit for rule or handle heavy duties. She favors stratigy over brute force, and would often personally adjust taxes, flow of mints or credit values on a massive scale between her nations in order for the economy to function without massive dips of depression or market crashings. Longlin views her duties as a chess game, and her goal is to keep it balanced on all sides.

Longlin views war as a waste of finite resources, despite her former title as a War General, she despises war as it is a factor of inbalance for the war time economy it brings. Conflicts without a proper reason is just a waste. Even with every resources at her disposal, she still favors conserving resources.

She has the keen senses to read people's emotions and accurately predict how people and their properties disperse, however, she often fails expressing emotions on her own.


#### Abilities

- Longlin's "Divine Spear", also known as Spear of Massiah, is only used for when a nation in the empire is under serious threat, a type of threat that the nation's leaders are unable to solve on their own. It has the power to vaporize regular matter into antimatter in a controlled scale, as well as create a barrier and or rift in space by warping the space around it due to extreme force. The spear alone can open the Gate of Guf[^3]; An imaginary space opposite to that of reality. So called, "Spear of Massiah" is due to it only being used in order to save a nation from disaster.
- Process data in extreme speeds. As the Emperor of Kinyakumo, along with her divine body, she has trained herself to read millions of data in matter of seconds. She has extreme reflex and can deflect any incoming attacks up to 99% speed of light. She can read attacks almost 1 second from the future.
- Due to her being a "pure dragon", she has the ability to change weather with her divine power, also due to this, she can manipulate certain elements to certain extend (Earth, Fire, Air, Water, aspects of growth and decay (does not including life and death)). There is no real scientific explaination for how she does it, it is suspected there are manipulation of imaginary at play.

[^3]: Gate of Guf is a portal to Guf, also known as Otzar, the treasury of souls described in hebrew teachings. However, in this case, Guf is also referring to the "Imaginary" realm. Imaginary is a realm where everything merges together, emotions, spirits and souls, it is a realm where everything and anything is possible. It is Tchai's explaination to the OC maker's imagination. A realm of creativity that is the human mind.

### Tsubaki's Divine Guardian - Fuyuchi Koyuki
[Insert koyuki_sprite.png here]

|**Name**|

| Kanji: *冬知 個雪*|
| Hiragana: *ふゆ ち こ ゆき*|
| Katakana: *フユ チ コ ユキ*|

|**Titles**|

|Occupation: *Divine Guardian of Tsubaki - Seat of Lion*|
| *"Queen's Guardian"*|
| *"Lion of Gui"*|
| *"Yuki"*|
| *"Goldie" -Vanessa*|

|**Characteristics**|
|     :-----------:     | 
| Age:    *25*    |
| Height: *5'7" (170 cm)*  |
| Gender: *Female*      |
| Specie: *Human(?)* |

#### Background
Fuyuchi Koyuki has no parents, she was found on a mountain when she was around 10. The local orphanage took her in, it is said that she could be a reincarnation of the Lion of Gui, the same Lion who felled Longlin from heaven, but there are no clear evidence on such a claim, the claim mostly stemed from her naturally golden blonde hair, the same luxurious fluff and shine as the fur of the Lion from the legends. She had no recollection of any memories prior to her discovery.

Koyuki has a natural talent in martial arts, and practice the arts of the swords at a young age, by the time she was 13, she defeated Kinyakumo's swordsmaster Guilin, because of her incredible skill, the headmaster of the orphanage often took her on tournaments, even if they were brutal. Koyuki never really got a chance to interact with other kids, except for the headmaster's kid; Vanessa. Koyuki mostly focused on honing her swordsmanship, however, as time goes on, Koyuki eventually felt that her talent was being extorted and exploited. She hosted a final duel between the headmaster and herself, which Koyuki won not soon after the duel even started. The headmaster, not admitting defeat, decided to pit Vanessa against Koyuki.

Vanessa has no prior skills in swords, she mostly practiced with spears and polearms, Koyuki, stunted by her own emotions, hesitated on attacking her only friend. Eventually as they grew tired, their senses dulled and they end up cutting each other from the shoulder to waist.

Even after injuries, the headmaster still pit them to fight against each other, still going on tours, but this time, it is just Vanessa and Koyuki fighting, it eventually got to the point that they almost killed each other in a duel, in one of the duels, Koyuki injured the nerves on her right arm, she had it amputated and replaced with a cybernetic prosthetic that looks the exact same as her old arm, in order to hide the fact that she got injuried.

They both shared the same room as they were hospitalized, Vanessa's forgetful, positive and happy-go-lucky attitude suggested that she and Koyuki should run away and live on their own, instead of always having to fight each other. At the time, they were both 17, they ran away from the orphanage, but the headmaster always chased them down. One day, Vanessa and her father (headmaster) got into a fight over personal freedom, in the heat of the argument, her father sliced her with a sword, reopening the old shoulder to waist wound she first got from Koyuki. Koyuki, rushing in to defend Vanessa, ended up decapitating the headmaster, killing him.

Afterwards, they decided to take whatever the headmaster had and run away, starting their own lives. Koyuki and Vanessa ended up going to their own separate paths, with Koyuki joining the police force whilist Vanessa entered college and became an intern at N.D.S.E.

Koyuki's heavy sense of duty quickly rose her rank to a police captain, she was also responsible for protecting the royal family members at the time (pre-first impact), that includes Tsubaki Koiwa, from the countless assassination attempts. Even with bribery and higher level orders from the head of the police department, Koyuki still stuck to her responsibility of protecting Koiwa, as demanded by the King at the time.

She is one of many who survived the first impact by shear luck, as she was summoned to the Lunarian Capital (space station) just days before the impact, however, also due to her being summoned there, the First Impact occured as she wasn't able to save Koiwa from being burnt. She regrets accepting the summon and decides to dedicate herself as Koiwa's bodyguard and part-time police officer post-impact. This caused Koiwa to fall in love with her and personally promoted her to the Divine Guardian Council. Because of her excellent mastery of swords and her extensive knowledge from her police duties, she was able to pass the entry exam with ease. Although there are skepticisms from the other members of the Divine Guardians due to the council members all joined at younger ages and are now hundreds of years old, Koyuki is the only young member of the council, even so, they accepted her, as the last Divine Guardian of Tsubaki perished hundreds of years ago, and they have not yet found a replacement till now.

#### Personality
Koyuki has a heavy sense of duty, she is still very much married to her policing job, and would still assist in law enforcement whenever she can. Her strong sense of justice and her skills had the citizens giving her the "Lion of Gui" nickname, referencing the Lion General from Heaven who was the primary figure for "good, selfless warrior". She has trouble expressing herself and often can't find the right words to describe emotions, however she is very understanding of criminal psychology. She is very stern and doesn't often understand jokes or hints of romance, she always speak in a formal, poetic manner, she is also polite and good mannered. Koyuki is incredibly brave, so much so that she often puts her life on the line, but would still miraculously get the job done. She tries to solve conflicts by talking or compromises, fighting is only last resort.

#### Abilities
- Extreme speed and agility, mainly due to her years of sword practicing and martial arts.
- Can utilize any object as a weapon, if she can move it, it's a weapon
- Photographic memories (specifically for maps and faces)
- EMP disruption, it comes from the cybernetic mod inside the prosthetic arm.
- Ambidextrous, she has the ability to use either hand to perform skillful tasks.

[^1]: Age of when Koiwa became Immortal

#### Background
Tsubaki Koiwa was one of the "pure" human bloodline, a bloodline stem from the original Earth, where they have no genetic mods. At most, they have implants that help with their skeletal, besides that, the Tsubaki royal bloodline is very against implants or genetic modding.

Koiwa was borned with pink hair, fading to blue on the tips, her eyes were also a gradient of pink to blue. These features shocked the royal family, believing that her mother had utilized a gene mod in secret, however, with multiple testings, it is suggested that Koiwa's mother never used any type of modifications, and that Koiwa was naturally just born with those features. Because of this, Koiwa immedietly became the favorite of the King, believing that she is blessed by the divine. Her relatives became jealous of her, spreading vicious rumours and lies, in attempt to ruin Koiwa's reputation. 

Even with evident lack of genetic modding, said claim still circulates around the royal family, with the other members of the family even go as far as tamper DNA or purposely set up evidence to show that her mother had attempted genetic modification, to that point that they outright accused her mother of violating family code.

When Koiwa was only 15, she was forced to witness as the royal family members set fire, burning Koiwa's mother alive.

After her mother's brutal death, Koiwa decides that she wants to abandon royal family duties and become a normal citizen, pursuing the study of medicine, however, she is always dragged back by the King, in attempts to prepare her for rule.

On the day of throne competition, in order to remove Koiwa out of the picture, the other members of the royal family tied her up, and set fire, burning Koiwa as they did to her mother years prior. The cries of Koiwa caught the attention of the Divine Phoenix, who saw her strong desire for revenge of the injust and to survive.

The Divine lent her a hand, and Koiwa was resurrected from the cinders of her burnt corpse, into a new immortal body, whilist caused the devestating event that is the First Impact.

#### First Impact
|Incident Stats|
|---|
|Area of Impact: Heavy Impact at the Eastern hemisphere(10 ~ 20 KM radius) of Neodynus, a crater around 11 KM(36K ft) deep[^2]. The effects of the impact spread across the globe|
|Casualties: ~700 Million|
[^2]: Depth of the Mariana Trench

The most devestating event that Neodynus, or the nation of Tsubaki has ever experienced. It was a sudden, explosive rage of fire that swept through everything on the planet. At the core of the explosion, it was estimated that temperature had reached 30 million degrees C (54 million F), twice that of the core of the sun. It was calculated that heat of that magnitude would of completely vaporized the planet, however, by some miracle unexplained, it was only heavily effected around a certain range. It was suspected that a Gate of Guf was opened right below the source of the explosion, to dampen the effects. This hasn't been confirmed by the Emperor Longlin yet, as she would be the only person to be able to freely open the Gate of Guf

At the moment of explosion, the sight was what could only be described as "a God emerging from Earth", with its firey wings spread out, standing on the planet, accompanied by rains of fire and uncanny screeches that can only be described as "souls coming from hell seeking for revenge". Noted from the spacestation of Neodynus; Lunarian Capital, the space station that was also an artifical moon for Neodynus.

[Will also provide imagery/audio for this too]

The effect of the impact lasted around 2 to 3 years, with the planet graduately cooling overtime. The First Command of N.D.S.E, Vanessa Haganehara, came up with the planet cooling towers that could withstand the temperature of the sun. With careful mission control, the towers were dropped on the planet in order to accelerate cooling. When the planet cooled down to a safer temperature. Vanessa herself extracted Koiwa from the Phoenix core, that at the time, was only as hot as magma.

#### Post-First Impact
Nation of Tsubaki was able to quickly recover thanks to efforts of N.D.S.E, however, every last of the royal family perished, leaving only Koiwa. Automatically, Koiwa became the new Queen of Tsubaki. To surpress suspicions and outrage due to First Impact, N.D.S.E had to control the media and place white lies in order to steer the possible rebellion that could stem from Koiwa becoming Queen. Afterall, she caused the First Impact, even if it wasn't intentional.

#### Realm-Expansion Project
Tsubaki was choosen as the lead for the Realm-Expansion Project, or R.E.P, initiated by the Emperor Longlin and The Divine Guardian Council. At this point, Koiwa has gotten used to being a leading figure, even though she was mostly guided with the help of the Divine Guardian assigned to her nation, as well as N.D.S.E.

The purpose of this project is to further study the effects of quantum-imaginary portals, and to expand on the "Many-Worlds" theorem. As well as to aid The Divine Guardians for their research needs for the super machine.

Koiwa has no choice but to oblige.

New realm already has other nations, however, Koiwa decides to stay neutral, sticking to the "no attacking unless threatened" rule.

#### Personality
Koiwa herself has a playful, fruity and sly personality, likes to flirt with women (specifically her Divine Guardian), sometimes shy and dislikes talking to outsiders. She doesn't often take things seriously and "memes" around, she prefers that way in order to hide the emotional trauma she has from the First Impact. When she is serious, it feels off putting and unpredictable. She dispises fire, or any flame related thing, such as flickering lights, kitchen stoves, lighters, even paper fires used for stage prop. She also dislikes spicy food and has a cat's tongue when it comes to hot foods.

However, her phoenix counterpart is straightforward, often deemed as rude but honest, offensivly logical and hard to debate with for her quick wits for pointing out flaws in debates.

#### Abilities
- "Divine Spear" Spear of Veritas, it has the ability to morph to adjust with its surroundings. Like the Divine Spear that Longlin wields, it has the ability to open Gate of Guf, however Koiwa has not grant the ability to control that yet. Koiwa calls the spear as the "brutally honest toothpick", as it is named after a Roman Goddess of Truth. It is the ultimate weapon of Tsubaki that only Koiwa; now a Divine being, can wield and control.
- Diverse knowledge in medicine and medical, can make almost any type of medicine (given materials).

## Top 3-5 things about your nation

This is kinda of a TLDR where you list your top 5 things that are unique or different about your nation. Be creative!

* Kinyakumo is a trade oriented nation.
* Kinyakumo has the ability to immedietly leave realm when threatened, with its quantum-imaginary technology.
* Tech-only nation, everything Kinyakumo is researching or has are all based off of real life quantum physics topics.
* Giant Robot by the palace
* East Asian styled builds, along with industrial/brutalist styles building, Most Kinyakumo buildings are massive (Uni coming soon!!!)
