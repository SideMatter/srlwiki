## About the Grand Elder

*images coming soon*

Name: Emi; Full name: Emily Sìth-Matsuzaki

Age: 20 years

Size: 5'1 tall, 125 lbs

Birthday: December 14

Star sign: Sagittarious

Weapons of Choice: *Excalibur's Judgement* sword, *Tome of the Ancients* spellbook

Backstory: After The Great Tragedy, the survivors that were left stayed in Yosokoa. A few centuries pass, and eventually Emi was born in Yosokoa. Her parents, a few months into her life, decided to leave for reasons unknown, and left her at the palace steps. Emperor Nazerious and Empress Tamayo took the young girl in and raised her as the princess of Yosokoa.

As Emi grew up, she was tutored and trained by Naz. She had also taken part in Yokosoa's traditions with her adoptive parents and older brother, believing she was truly a Yosokoan. When Emi was 17, Naz decided she was old enough to learn the truth about her nationality and lineage. She was from a long-dead nation and descended from the line of Grand Elders.

When she turned 18, Naz showed her the ruins of said nation. She decided to take on the challenge of resurrecting the long-dormant nation. She was granted dual citizenship for Yosokoa and Kirameku and became the first Grand Elder in 600 years. And even after meeting the spirits of her true family members and others that came before her, she holds her place in Yosokoa and its imperial family close to heart and honors both nations and cultures.

At the age of 20, she meets Saph and asks him to co-lead Kirameku with her as the second elder. While Emi focuses most of her time and energy into her responsibilities in Kirameku, she still concerns herself with Yosokoa's matters and occassionally offers her say on some matters as well as visit her adoptive family.

Extra info: As the last Kiramekan left, she has a strong personal tie to Kirameku's traditions around the dead, especially with how Kirameku had first met its end. It's not easy making an enemy of her but if you want to ensure peace with her, best not to either threaten Kirameku or be rude towards her or her family (she especially gets mad when called a demon or told "Spiorad wasn't a good leader anyway". Also even if it's something she's been working on she can still jump to conclusions too quickly or be very reactive.


## The Second Elder

*images coming soon*

Name: Saph; Full name: Saphir Eachdraiche

Age: 21 years

Size: 5'7 tall, 140 lbs

Birthday: September 21

Star Sign: Libra

Weapon of choice: Iron sword

Backstory: A wandering historian. He enjoys traveling the world, getting to know other people, and learning about all the diverse histories and cultures. He also isn't afraid to dive into all history - even the bad and ugly side of the world's nature. 
He was travelling through the area near the western nations when Kinyakumo and Yosokoa closed their borders. Unable to visit either nation, he made Kirameku his next stop. After learning of its history, he finds Emi's mission an admirable feat and decided that he would help. He's got no experience of a world leader but he knows enough from speaking with other world leaders and historians to give tips based on what worked for some nations and what hasn't worked for other nations and then match them with Emi's convictions.

He is also of Kiramekan descent, despite not being able to conjure magic. He is from one of the bloodlines of elders in Kirameku. His family was able to escape the attacks on Kirameku and even aided the escape for those who didn't leave early enough, found shelter, and were able to survive. After the attacks had fully calmed down, the family didn't feel safe living in the region anymore so they left to go farther away. Over the 600 years, enough non-magics married into the family to make it so even if Saph does have some abilities, he's not able to conjure and use magic traditionally.

Extra info: The Eachdraiche family crest was kept over the years and now is carried around by Saph so he could learn the truth of his lineage someday.

## Historical figure of Importance: Spiorad

*image coming soon*

Name: Spiorad; Full name: Spiorad Sìth

Age *at death*: 194 years

Age *current*: 795 years

Date of birth: January 6, 1229

Date of death: October 20, 1423

Star sign: Capricorn

Backstory: Spiorad is known for being the last Grand Elder of Kirameku's golden age. He was soon to retire and give his role to his heir had tragedy not struck. When Evrn accidentally cast the withering spell, he had a heavy heart when he still had to punish him. When Coirbeachd struck, Spiorad ordered an evacuation and then he and the other elders sealed him away. When the genocide started, with no real defense, he was left to have as many people as possible evacuate to the underground bunker in the capital as attackers moved in. He felt it best to get as many records about Kirameku as possible to Yosokoa to be preserved and he was attacked on the road back. Instead of running and potentially putting his people in further danger, he allowed himself to be killed. His death marked the official end of Kirameku's golden age and the start of the era of shadows. After Emi starts working on restoring the faction, he provides some aid through advice even after death.


## Historical Figure of Importance: Evrn

*images coming soon*

Name: Evrn; Full name: Evrn Sìth

Age *at death*: 18

Age *current*: 618

Date of Birth: September 11, 1405

Date of Death: September 30, 1423

Star Sign: Virgo

Backstory: Evrn was the original heir to Spiorad's position of power. He was strong and very reactive but despite his strength he also was a young man with a soft side and strong love for his girlfriend, Amelia. He'd always meet with Amelia on a hillside located in present-day Kinyakumo. On Amelia's 18th birthday, he originally had planned to surprise her by casting a spell to fill the valley below wtih alliums, her favorite flower. However, instead he accidentally used the withering spell on her. Even though she wasn't permanently hurt, he still was banished. His anger was great enough he accidentally created and got possessed by Coirbeachd. He was left unaware of what was happening since. Next thing he knew, he woke up after Coirbeachd was sealed away, laying outside of Nazcorp in May of 2023, without a physical body. He learned that his actions led to Kirameku's downfall and he did everything he could to repent. It was discovered that his spirit and Coirbeachd were tied together and so long as he was trapped in the mortal world Coirbeachd would live. Evrn was able to serve his sentence on time to reunite with Amelia during the Festival of the Dead. His tie to Coirbeachd was severed and he was able to fully pass on and Coirbeachd had lost all his power.

Extra info: Evrn, alongside Spiorad, offers Emi help after death as needed. He still has a short fuse but is usually able to keep calm.


## Historical Figure of Importance: Amelia

*image coming soon*

Name: Amelia; Full name: Amelia Aotrom

Age *at death*: 18

Age *current*: 618

Date of birth: September 25, 1405

Date of death: October 1423 *exact date unknown*

Star Sign: Libra

Backstory: Amelia wasn't a mage of high status in her life. That didn't stop the love she had for Grand Heir Evrn. Her kind and peaceful nature balanced perfectly enough with Evrn's explosive nature to make the relationship a healthy one. On her 18th birthday, she met with Evrn on the hill she would usually meet him on and awaited her birthday gift. One second looking over a valley, the next she was collapsed on the ground with a sharp pain in her chest. Evrn was able to counter the withering spell quickly enough for her to be fine, but he still had consequences to face. His banishment was hard for her because she knew he didn't mean to almost hurt or kill her. While she was grieving for her boyfriend, Coirbeachd attacked. She and her family were among those who evacuated during this first attack. However, she was unable to return back home. It was believed that she and her family were among the first victims of the genocide that followed.


## History

Kirameku was first established 1500 years before present day. During that time, war had been raging among the multiple civilizations – tribes, villages, cities, and nations alike - of humans that lived in modern-day Kinyakumo, Kirameku, international territory, and RDS over the issues around magic. Non-magics perceived magic users as a threat that needed to be eliminated, while magic users were fighting in the name of self-defense, some even fighting because they feel superior to non-magics. There were also cultural differences with non-magics not having a good understanding and even being weirded out by magical culture and magic users feeling like the non-magics’ reasons for war are sinful and that karma will be coming back for them.

The people that started Kirameku are from a small hamlet off the coast west of the main island. They found themselves on the island after the hamlet got attacked in the middle of the war. One of the four decided that he’s had enough with the war and that he was going to make a nation meant to be a sanctuary from war, a nation fighting for peace through peace. Everyone else thought he was insane. It had been felt unanimously that any hope of peace between magical humans and non-magical humans was long gone. He asserted that he as going to try anyway – so in short the reason Kirameku even exists is because someone wanted to prove a point.

Its capital lies on the island immediately west of spawn and the nation has grown and shrunk from there. In the nation’s peak, it’s stretched out as far as present-day Kinyakumo, Sinivae, and RDS. Today, Kirameku only occupies the capital island and some islands to the south of Sidelabs, allowing the nations that now occupy the land that used to belong to Kirameku to keep the land. There’s also a temple far to the south that’s kept under protection.

As for how leadership works, there’s one main leader, the grand elder, who is the head and main representative of the nation. The other elders act as an extension of the grand elder and help divide up the responsibilities. In example, Kirameku in its glory days had 13 districts and 13 elders if you count the Grand Elder and the capital. Each elder was assigned a district and focused on the area’s on local issues and trade. Nowadays, Emi is over the southern island as well as culture and history preservation, magical matters, and defense while Saph is over the northern island as well as international relations and historical research and restoration.

But how did a nation that used to be almost as on top of the world as Yosokoa suddenly disappear, you may ask?


## The Great Tragedy

600 years before present day, the young mage training up to be the next grand elder, Evrn, accidentally used the forbidden withering spell when trying to surprise his girlfriend, Amelia, for her 18th birthday. Although Amelia was able to recover just fine, Evrn still had to face consequences. He was stripped of his future power and banished to the nether. He was angry, but angered enough to accidentally create and host Coirbeachd, a fire demon.

Coirbeachd wreaked havoc over Kirameku, forcing people to evacuate to neighboring nations, including the person who’s taken Evrn’s position. Grand Elder Spiorad and the other elders were able to seal him away in a wizard ring.

Neighboring kingdoms felt that Kirameku posed a threat to their safety and they responded by rushing Kirameku and eliminating its people. Most were burned at the pyre while others were tortured and enslaved to try to “work the demons and evil out of them”. The elders themselves were killed trying to protect their people. The survivors totaled up to 20 people at most who were able to flee or hide. Yosokoa was the only nearby faction to not go against Kirameku. Emperor Naz intervened when his friend, Spiorad, was killed and he spread a lie or two that dominoed into the factions attacking Kirameku going after each other until there was nothing left.

A year ago now, a young Emi came across Kirameku’s capital ruins and let her curiosity run rampant to the point she wanted to build the area back up. She finds the tome Spiorad intentionally left out that would allow her to unseal Coirbeachd and reseal him in a stronger seal, which she didn’t read that far since she freaked out about a demon being in the area, but instructions were still followed so mission failed successfully. Naz filled her in on the information on Kirameku that she needed to know in order to go forward in continuing the nation’s history.

Nowadays, Emi leads Kirameku with some extra help from a friend, Saph. Kirameku’s main focus is establishing a peaceful place where magic users and non-magics can peacefully coexist.


## Kiramekan Culture and Magic

A lot of Kirameku's culture is based around the magic present in the area's environment and traditions around the dead.

### Spirits

All of the spirits that appear in Kirameku are of past residents who are no longer alive. Most spirits like to visit home and family after death while occassionally there could be circumstances where a spirit is trapped in the mortal world and unable to pass on. They also believe that beings such as gods and demons are their own classification of spirits.

Most spirits do also keep an eye on Kirameku and react to things that happen, although they can't do anything about everything that happens other than past elders. If there's someone that is a good ally, they'll know. If someone is going to end up an enemy, they'll know. Most spirits accept everything that happens while others are more vocal about their excitement or distates.

How they appear depends on the time and person. They'll always fully appear to those of Kiramekan decent while for outsiders they could be seen as either a blue flame or an otherworldly light if they choose not to be visible. In Kirameku and allied cultures they're just referred to as spirits while in more neutral or hostile culture's they're referred to as Will-o'-the-Wisps.

### Vow of the Elders

Even after death, the past elders of Kirameku do still get to keep some of their powers. There was an oath made by all elder's in Kirameku's history to be a peaceful nation and to strive for a place where both magical and non-magical people can co-exist safely. With this, the elders can return to the mortal world to aid the current generation of elders. In emergency situations in combat, an elder can recite an incantation or prayer and one or a few spirits of the past would come and either offer support or fight alongside the elder.

This spell originated during the Great Tragedy at the Battle for the Kiramekan Temple. Even though the old meeting spot for the dead is secluded, it wasn't immune to the events. Hunters invaded and attacked the elders that were there. However, the elders refused to let the sacred area be burned down and left to ruin, so they fought back as spirits until all of the hunters have fallen.

## Trivia around Kirameku

Related to lore:
* The number of elders in the governing council grows and shrinks as the nation does. Right now it's just Emi and Saph, but at the nation's peak there were 13, including Grand Elder Spiorad.
* Those native to Kirameku can live up to around 200 years of age, due to the magic they carry. Those in leadership roles step down at the age of 195 to allow the next generation to step up.
* The national symbol is the blue monarch butterfly, representing Kirameku's rebirth and the culture around spirits and the dead.
* As a nation of mages and with the Grand Elder being the last living mage, Kirameku is well-known for their magic and their main export is books.
* The national motto is "Honoring yesterday's tragedies to realize tomorrow's miracles".


Not related to lore:
* The names for Saph and Emi come from gemstones. Emi = Emerald, Saph = Sapphire. Both characters are also OCs of Emi's and have been off and on used since 2018.
* The initial name for Kirameku was "Interdimensional Syndicate", sharing the name with Emi's instagram page for their comic. Another previous nation name was "The Arcanelands".
* Translations: The fire demon Coirbeachd's name is Scottish Gaelic for "corruption", the last grand elder Spiorad's name also comes from Gaelic, meaning "spirit", and the nation name Kirameku is Japanese for "sparkling".
* The older builds are based off of traditional Japanese architecture while newer builds and designs are based off of medieval Scottish/Celtic architecture and art. There are even a few references to Scottish culture in Kirameku's lore and culture, such as the Will-o'-the-Wisps. In real-world mythology, they can be seen as mischevious spirits of the dead to some but overall are painted in a negative light due to the belief they lead travellers to their death.
